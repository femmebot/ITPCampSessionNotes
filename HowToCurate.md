How To Curate An Exhibition
===========================

Caveats: This is personal, subjective, not necessarily rigorous, an experiment, in progress. I have been a curator since 2005 (in various capacities!) and these notes are based on my own personal experience.

#Welcome
* Background of participants
* What you want to learn
* An exhibit you saw recently and what made it successful/unsuccessful

#Start With An Idea
* Prompted by an idea, article, video, book, dance, etc
* Look at exhibits you like / why do you like them?
* Talk to people! (artists, curators, friends, etc)

#Write It Down
* Write it down! (a thesis/purpose statement)
* Email artists
* talk to artists/curators/etc
* Call For Artists!
* studio visits / digital studio visits (email!/skype/phone)

#What artists?
* genres
* approaches
* how do you reach people?
* diversity of artists - gender, age, race, sexuality, geographic area, etc

#Where to curate
* gallery - how?
* apartment
* cooperative art space
* online

* university spaces

#Logistics
* email/visit artist
* get titles, medium, date, price
* work out what happens if work is sold
* one night only? party? longer? music? speedshow? etc.

#Installation
